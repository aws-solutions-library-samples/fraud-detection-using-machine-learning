    "* `eta`: This is the step size shrinkage applied at each update. This value will shrink the weights of new features to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "* `gamma`: This is the minimum loss reduction to reach before splitting a leaf. Splitting a leaf can sometimes have a small benefit, and splitting such leaves can lead to overfitting. By setting `gamma` to values larger than zero, we ensure that there should be at least some non-negligible amount of accuracy gain before splitting a leaf.\n",
