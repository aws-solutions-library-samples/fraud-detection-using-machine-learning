# Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

With businesses moving online, fraud, and abuse in online systems is constantly increasing as well. Traditionally, rule-based fraud detection systems are used to combat online fraud, but these rely on a static set of rules created by human experts. This project uses machine learning to create models for fraud detection that are dynamic, self-improving, and maintainable. Importantly, they can scale with the online business.

Specifically, we show how to use Amazon SageMaker to train supervised and unsupervised machine learning models on historical transactions, so that they can predict the likelihood of incoming transactions being fraudulent or not. We also show how to deploy the models, once trained, to a REST API that can be integrated into an existing business software in fracture. This project includes a demonstration of this process using a public, anonymized credit card transactions [dataset provided by ULB](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), but can be easily modified to work with custom labeled or unlabeled data provided as a relational table in CSV format.

## Getting Started

To get started quickly, use the following quick-launch link to launch a CloudFormation Stack create form and follow the instructions below to deploy the resources in this project.

### Additional Instructions

* On the stack creation page, check the box to acknowledge the creation of IAM resources, and click **Create Stack**. This should trigger the creation of the CloudFormation stack.

* Once the stack is created, go to the Outputs tab and click on the *SageMakerNotebook* link. This will open up a Jupyter notebook named `sagemaker_fraud_detection` in a SageMaker Notebook instance where you can run the code. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the solution. You can use `Cells->Run All` from the Jupyter menu to run all cells and return to the notebook later after all cells have been executed. The total time to run all cells should be around 40 minutes.

## Architecture

The project architecture deployed by the cloud formation template is shown here.

## Project Description
The project uses Amazon SageMaker to train both a supervised and unsupervised machine learning models, which are then deployed using Amazon Sagemaker-managed endpoints.

If you have labels for your data, for example, if some of the transactions have been annotated as fraudulent and some as legitimate, then you can train a supervised learning model to learn to discern the two classes. In this project, we provide a recipe to train a gradient boosted decision tree model using [XGBoost on Amazon SageMaker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/xgboost.html). The supervised model training process also handles the common issue of working with highly imbalanced data in fraud detection problems. The project addresses this issue in two ways by 1) implementing data upsampling using the "imbalanced-learn" package, and 2) using scale position weight to control the balance of positive and negative weights.

If you don't have labeled data or if you want to augment your supervised model predictions with an anomaly score from an unsupervised model, then the project also trains a [RandomCutForest](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/randomcutforest.html) model using Amazon SageMaker. The RandomCutForest algorithm is trained on the entire dataset, without labels, and takes advantage of the highly imbalanced nature of fraud datasets, to predict higher anomaly scores for the fraudulent transactions in the dataset.

Both of the trained models are deployed to Amazon SageMaker managed real-time endpoints that host the models and can be invoked to provide model predictions for new transactions.

The model training and endpoint deployment is orchestrated by running a [jupyter notebook](source/notebooks/sagemaker_fraud_detection.ipynb) on a SageMaker Notebook instance. The Jupiter notebook runs a demonstration of the project using the aforementioned anonymized credit card dataset that is automatically downloaded to the Amazon S3 Bucket created when you launch the solution. However, the notebook can be modified to run the project on a custom dataset in S3. The notebook instance also contains some example code that shows how to invoke the REST API for inference.

To encapsulate the project as a stand-alone microservice, Amazon API Gateway is used to provide a REST API, that is backed by an AWS Lambda function. The Lambda function runs the [code](https://github.com/awslabs/fraud-detection-using-machine-learning/blob/master/source/fraud_detection/index.py) to preprocess incoming transactions, invoke Pagemaker endpoints, merge results from both endpoints if necessary, store the model inputs and model predictions in S3 via Kinesis Firehose, and provide a response to the client.

## Data


The example dataset used in this solution was originally released as part of a research collaboration of Worldline and
the Machine Learning Group (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (Université Libre de Bruxelles) on big data mining and fraud
detection.

The dataset contains credit card transactions from European cardholders in 2013. As is common in fraud detection,
it is highly unbalanced, with 492 fraudulent transactions out of the 284,807 total transactions. The dataset contains
only numerical features because the original features have been transformed for confidentiality using PCA. As a result,
the dataset contains 28 PCA components, and two features that haven't been transformed, _Amount_ and _Time_.
_Amount_ refers to the transaction amount, and _Time_ is the seconds elapsed between any transaction in the data
and the first transaction.
